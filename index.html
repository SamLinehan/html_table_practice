    <h2>Cities I've Lived In</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Ipswich for the first 18 years of my life. I moved to Burlington to attend college for one year. I lived in Waltham, MA for my sophomore and junior years of college. I moved to Newburyport and commuted for my senior year. After college, I moved to LA for a few months for a new adventure. I finally settled in Austin after visiting on my drive to LA.</p>

    <h2>Cities I Would Like to Visit</h2>
      <p>Mendoza is a great food and wine city, as well as one of the gateway cities to Patagonia. Melbourne looks like a thriving metropolis and seems to be a great first city to visit while in Australia. Tangier has a great food culture with a variety of markets.</p>
